# C++ Games

Those are the mini games I created during a one-week hackathon hosted by Orange and AMIT Learning. We used a graphics library called [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).
To run this code you will first need to download [CodeBlocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/) Then follow **[this video](https://youtu.be/fcZFaiGFIMA)** to be able to install SFML and run it. Then just open the .cbp file.

The Ice Tower game is the one I'm most proud of to be honest ðŸ˜„
